\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Data Collection}

The data for this project was sourced directly from JP Morgan, which provided level 2 datasets including tapes and Limit Order Books (LOB). Tapes consist of a sequential record of all transaction prices and volumes, effectively capturing market activity over the course of the trading day. The LOB data comprises all outstanding orders and provides detailed insights into buy and sell orders at various price levels, crucial for analyzing market depth and price dynamics. This comprehensive data collection was foundational for developing accurate financial models and simulations.

\subsection{Visualization}
In order to visualise what we were working on, we mainly used Python to draw relevant images, including aspects of data exploration, model prediction results and so on. This helped us to get a fuller picture of our large dataset and prepared us for feature engineering.

\subsection{Model Selection and Implementation}

\subsubsection{ARIMA}
Initially, the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was employed for baseline predictions. This model is suitable for univariate time series data that shows evidence of autocorrelation and non-stationarity. The model parameters \(p, d, q\) were determined based on the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots, alongside AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) for optimizing the model fit.

\subsubsection{Machine Learning Techniques}
Following the ARIMA implementation, machine learning techniques were explored to improve prediction accuracy and handle non-linear patterns:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{XGBoost}: A gradient boosting framework that uses decision tree ensembles. It was configured to handle the time series data by incorporating past data points as features to predict future values.
    \item \textbf{Random Forest}: An ensemble learning method for regression using multiple decision trees. It was particularly utilized to assess feature importance and understand which variables most significantly impact LOB prices.
\end{itemize}
Both models were trained using a rolling window approach to validate their performance and adjust parameters dynamically based on the evolving data characteristics.

\subsubsection{LSTM}
Given the sequential nature of time series data, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network was implemented as the final model. LSTM networks are well-suited for making predictions based on time series data due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies. The network architecture included multiple LSTM layers followed by dense layers to effectively learn from the historical LOB price movements. We also add some dropout layers and regularization to prevent model from overfitting.

The diagram illustrates the intricate mechanisms of an LSTM cell at time step \( t \). The LSTM cell comprises three gates: the input gate (\( z^i \)), the forget gate (\( z^f \)), and the output gate (\( z^o \)), which work in unison to regulate the flow of information. These gates collectively decide which information is retained or discarded as the cell updates its state.

At each time step, the cell state (\( c^t \)) is updated through a combination of the previous cell state (\( c^{t-1} \)) and the new candidate values, moderated by the forget and input gates. This allows the network to carry forward relevant information through time, addressing the vanishing gradient problem commonly associated with standard recurrent neural networks. The hidden state (\( h^t \)), which encapsulates the current cell output, is then computed using the updated cell state and the output gate. This hidden state serves as the input to the subsequent LSTM cell at time \( t+1 \) and is also used in calculating the output of the current time step (\( y^t \)).

\end{figure}

The configuration of the LSTM model was optimized through hyperparameter tuning.
The model was trained using the Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function.
The training process involved feeding the model with historical LOB data and iteratively updating the weights to minimize the loss.
The model was evaluated on a separate test set(the last 10\% of the whole data) to assess its predictive performance and generalization capabilities.
Below is the basic configuration of the LSTM model:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Batch Size}: 256
    \item \textbf{Learning Rate}: 0.001
    \item \textbf{Epochs}: 50
    \item \textbf{Sequence Length}: 20
    \item \textbf{Feature Dimension}: 16
    \item \textbf{LSTM Layers}: 2
    \item \textbf{Hidden Size}: 256 units
    \item \textbf{Dropout Rate}: 0.2
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Trading Simulator Development}
Using the forecasts generated from the LSTM model, a trading simulator was constructed to simulate real-world trading. This simulator utilized the predictions to make trading decisions, attempting to maximize profits through strategic buy and sell orders. The trading strategy was based on a set of predetermined rules derived from the historical data patterns and predictive signals obtained from the model.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
Model performance was assessed using several metrics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mean Absolute Error (MAE)} for accuracy of predictions generated from regression model.
    \item \textbf{F1 Score} for performance of classification model.
    \item \textbf{Profitability}: The effectiveness of the trading simulator was measured by the profit generated during the simulation period.
\end{itemize}

\section{DATA DESCRIPTION/ PREPARATION}
\subsection{Data Description}
The data contains information on trading tapes (\emph{Tapes}) and limit order books (\emph{LOBs}) for a number of consecutive days. This data is used to analyse and model the behaviour of financial markets and to build trading simulators.

\textbf{Tapes:} Contains detailed information about each trade, such as the time of the trade, the number of trades, and the price at which they were executed. It is often used to refer to trading activity and data flow in the marketplace, especially the real-time quotes and transaction details of stock trades.

\textbf{LOB (Limit Order Book):} Records all open buy and sell orders in the market at a given moment. Each record contains the price, quantity, direction (buy or sell) of the order, the time the order was submitted and the exchange identification. In the financial markets, a limit order book is a mechanism for recording and ordering buy and sell orders on an exchange or trading platform. Each order specifies a price and quantity. Buy orders (the price at which to buy) will be listed in descending order, while sell orders (the price at which to sell) will be listed in descending order. This helps the trader to understand the supply and demand situation in the market, as well as the possible direction of price movements.

\subsection{Data Preparation}
Tape data is stored in csv format and LOB data is stored in txt format. Our first job is to parse the data and clean and merge it.

For Tape data, the date information contained in the file name is extracted directly and inserted as a new column in each file, and then all Tape data is merged in time order.

For LOB data, we wrote a Python script to parse the txt file, extract the date of the file name, and keep only Max Bid Price and Min Ask Price for each time point, which we think are the most important in LOB data, and also the most intuitive reflection of the market price trend. Accordingly, we keep the corresponding Max Bid Quantity and Min Ask Quantity, as well as the Total Bid/Ask Quantity for each time point, which can reflect the market depth information. Finally, all LOB files are merged to facilitate subsequent modelling.

We performed a simple data cleaning including removal of missing values, extraction of sliding window features as well as some features in the financial domain such as RSI, OFI (Order Flow Imbalance), etc., which were used as trading signals when we built the trading simulator later.


\subsection{Example sub-section}\label{AA}
Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, 
even after they have been defined in the abstract.

Number equations consecutively. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus
sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a 
sentence, as in:
\begin{equation}
a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
\end{equation}

Be sure that the 
symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following 
the equation. Use ``\eqref{eq}'', not ``Eq.~\eqref{eq}'' or ``equation \eqref{eq}'', except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq} is . . .''

\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}
\begin{itemize}
\item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
\item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
\item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.
\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.
\item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.
\item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
\item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.
\item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.
\end{itemize}
An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{b7}.


\subsection{Figures and Tables}
\paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and 
bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large 
figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be 
below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert 
figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation 
``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Table Type Styles}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Table}&\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\textbf{Table Column Head}} \\
\cline{2-4} 
\textbf{Head} & \textbf{\textit{Table column subhead}}& \textbf{\textit{Subhead}}& \textbf{\textit{Subhead}} \\
\hline
copy& More table copy$^{\mathrm{a}}$& &  \\
\hline
\multicolumn{4}{l}{$^{\mathrm{a}}$Sample of a Table footnote.}
\end{tabular}
\label{tab1}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics{fig1.png}}
\caption{Example of a figure caption.}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words 
rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to 
avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity 
``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including 
units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only 
with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization 
\{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of 
quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not 
``Temperature/K''.

\subsection{References}

Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
element symbols.
